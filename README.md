# NYC Cloud Archive ☁️ ☁️ 

A small web project built with React that lets users explore collections of cloud photographs I captured across different times of day in New York City.  

Over time, I’ve come to appreciate the subtle moods and shifting atmospheres above the city — and this site is my way of sharing that!

## 🌤

The site invites users to select from 3 time intervals. Each time interval displays a series of cloud photos I took during that respective time across multiple days. The background color and accompanying ASCII art changes with each time interval-- creating a subtle rhythm + personality for each moment of the time interval across the days.
